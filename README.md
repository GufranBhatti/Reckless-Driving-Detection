# Reckless-Driving-Detection
This was my university course project (Ubiquotous Computing and IoT) where using a dataset I acquired from kaggle, I trained an AI model which detects if a person is driving recklessly or not. This repository contain some word documents which explains the project and jupyter notebook files for training the model. I want to give credits to my project partners Sarim Amir (SarimAmir) and Abdul Bari (abdulbari209).
